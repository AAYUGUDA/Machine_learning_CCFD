Machine learning project on Credit Card Fraud Detection Using LogisticRegression()


## Problem Statement:
The increasing number of credit card transactions has led to a rise in fraudulent activities. The challenge is to build a machine learning model that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions, which are typically rare compared to the number of legitimate transactions.

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to use Python and a Logistic Regression model to create a binary classification system that can predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. The model will be trained and tested on a dataset containing credit card transactions, where each transaction is labeled as either 'fraudulent' or 'legal'.

## Results:
After preprocessing the data and training the Logistic Regression model, it was able to achieve a training accuracy of 92%, and a predictive accuracy of 89% on the test set. These metrics indicate that the model was able to correctly identify a significant number of fraudulent transactions, while also minimizing the number of false positives. However, there is still room for improvement, as the model also misclassified some transactions. Future work could involve tuning the model parameters or trying different machine learning algorithms to further improve the performance. 

Please note that the actual results may vary depending on the specific dataset used and the parameters chosen for the Logistic Regression model.
